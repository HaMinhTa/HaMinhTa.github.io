      <p>The H1B is one of the most popular non-immigrant work visas for international students to the U.S. If you are a prospective or are currently an international student, chances are that you will come across people talking about or applying for this visa and you will one day need to get one yourself.
      </p>

      <p>Policies revolving around the visa have been changing and can affect applicants' chances of getting the visa. Visualizations in this page are based on data collected from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servicesâ€™ <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub-files">Employer Data Hub</a>. The USCIS is the agency responsible for managing the process of applying for H-1B visas.</p>
