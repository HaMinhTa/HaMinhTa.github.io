    <div class="bodytext">
        <p>The coronavirus outbreak has seem to hit the U.S. hard. As of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52258284">April 12</a>, US death toll has overtaken Italy as world's highest, with New York state being the epicenter of the outbreak. The country is well on its way to end up with the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the industrialized world. How did a country with supposedly the best medical infrastructure in the world be so ill-prepared for the pandemic when we were warned about it since early January. Let's take a look at the difference in reactions to the coronavirus situation between President Trump's and health experts, scientists, the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization (WHO) by looking at the sentiment scores for their speeches, articles or tweets.</p>
        <p>The project uses lexicon <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html">“Bing” and R scripts</a> to analyze the sentiments of the texts. The “Bing” lexicon assigns words into positive and negative categories with scores. Articles are mostly written by the health experts themselves. The colors of the text boxes represent the sentiment of the texts. Shades of red color represent “negative” sentiment (having “Bing” score lower than 0). Shades of blue represent “positive” sentiment (having “Bing” score greater than 0). White color represent a “Bing” score of zero.</p>
        <p>The sentiment scores are not reflective or intended to be reflective of any specific quality of the texts and the speakers, nor are they useful in representing and illustrating the complexities and nuances of these texts. They simply provide a unit of measurement to measure and illustrate a contrast in reactions from two sides. Thus, snippets of the respective texts as well as link to the full texts are provided in each textbox for your reference.

          <h2>Summary of methodology</h2>
          <h3>Sentiment analysis</h3>
            <p>
              The project uses lexicon “Bing” and R scripts to analyze the sentiments of the texts. The “Bing” lexicon assigns words into positive and negative categories with scores. Texts by health experts are retrieved mostly from op-ed articles written by the health experts themselves.        
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The sentiment analysis of texts from Trump with the Bing lexicon returned scores between 2 to 17. Meanwhile, sentiment analysis of texts from health experts, the HHS and the WHO returned scores between -2 and -34.
            </p>
              
            <p>
              The binary comparison of this visualization hinders the ability to see the complexities in the responses, both by the President and by health experts. It also comes across as assuming that the contrast in reaction is a good versus bad comparison, when in fact, the reality is much more complicated than that.
            </p>
            
            <p>The small snippets, together with the varying degrees of positivity or negativity are added in the hope to offset the simplicity and personal bias to an extent. When the method of analysis was (negative and positive spectrum) chosen for the project, it was intended to help highlight the contrasting reactions, but what it lost was richness of the sentiments (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise…). These are the shortcomings of the visualization’s analysis method.
            </p>
         <h3>Origins of articles, speeches and tweets from Trump, the WHO, the HHS and health experts</h3>
          <p>Texts analyzed in this project are taken from transcripts of interviews and rallies by President Trump or published on President Trump's Twitter, the WHO's website, the HHS's website, the White House's website as well as on the following publications, which has been checked of the “media bias check” on <a href="mediabiasfactcheck.com">mediabiasfactcheck.com</a>:</p>

            <p>Below are descriptions of each type of categorization by mediabiasfactcheck.com:</p>
          
            <h4>LEFT-CENTER BIAS</h4>
            <p>
            These media sources have a slight to moderate liberal bias.  They often publish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor liberal causes.  These sources are generally trustworthy for information, but may require further investigation.</p>
            
            <h4>LEAST BIASED</h4>
            <p>
            These sources have minimal bias and use very few loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes).  The reporting is factual and usually sourced.  These are the most credible media sources.</p>
            
            <h4>RIGHT-CENTER BIAS</h4>
            <p>
            These media sources are slightly to moderately conservative in bias. They often publish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor conservative causes. These sources are generally trustworthy for information, but may require further investigation.</p>

            <h4>RIGHT BIAS</h4>
            <p>
            These media sources are moderately to strongly biased toward conservative causes through story selection and/or political affiliation. They may utilize strong loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes), publish misleading reports and omit reporting of information that may damage conservative causes. Some sources in this category may be untrustworthy.</p>
