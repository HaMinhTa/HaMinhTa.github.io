            <div class="bodyText">
                <p>On April 27, 1943, Edwin Clifford Williams, his wife, Lillian, and two young sons, were on their way
                    home from Beautiful Zion Baptist Church. As they passed under the Newton Street Viaduct in Algiers,
                    three white navy sailors, 19-year-old Walter Curry Sherwood, Paul O’Malley, and A.B. Bright were
                    drinking above the viaduct. The sailors, for reasons unknown, proceeded to pour beer over Lillian
                    and their infant son. When Williams protested, the sailors descended from above the viaduct, smashed
                    some beer bottles, and stabbed him with a broken bottle in front of his family.
                </p>

                <p>The day after her husband’s death, Lillian Alveris Williams provided a statement to Daniel Byrd, then
                    president of the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP. Byrd alerted Thurgood Marshall, who
                    closely followed the proceedings. Despite these efforts, the family never received justice in court.
                </p>

                <p>Only one of the assailants was ever tried, and he was acquitted of manslaughter charges after less
                    than an hour of deliberations by a jury. Nearly 80 years later, attention to Williams' murder was
                    revived through a clinic by the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project (CRRJ) at Northeastern
                    University School of Law, which offers opportunities for students to work in the domains of
                    historical redress and criminal justice reform.</p>

                <p>Students in the clinic investigate cases available in the Burnham-Nobles
                    archive, a collection of racial killings of Black people between 1930 and 1954 in the
                    Jim Crow South. Erin McCrady, a law student, investigated the case between 2020 and 2021.
                </p>

                <p>Williams’ story was one in more than a thousand stories of unjust killing of Black lives in the Jim
                    Crow South documented in the Burnham-Nobles archive, which was made available publicly in October,
                    2022. The Archive brings together evidence demonstrating the extensive scale and scope of killings
                    between 1930 and 1954 in the Jim Crow South.
                </p>

                <p>Circumstances and allegations against the victims that eventually led to their killings were
                    wide-ranging.</p>

                <p>They included, but were not limited to, murdering a police officer, murdering a white landlord over a
                    debt, attacking a white man, raping a white woman, attempting to rape a white woman, writing to a
                    white woman, having romantic relations with a white woman, making untrue statements about a white
                    woman, bumping into a white woman, committing burglary, winning too much at gambling, quitting a
                    job, failing to show up to work, driving erraticly, arguing over wages, raising fist in a sign of
                    aggression, peeping into a neighbor's window, refusing to say "yes, sir" and "no, sir" to a police
                    officer, refusing to obey a white man's order to tuck in his shirt, engaging in union organizing,
                    trying to mediate an argument over bus fares between a bus driver and a 17-year-old boy, protesting
                    son’s arrest, being near a traffic accident, crossing a municipal golf course, loitering, sitting on
                    a bench, or, in William’s case, defending his family from assault.

                                <p class='step'>59% of the victims were killed by law enforcement

                                    The Burnham-Nobles Archive based its decision to include cases involving police
                                    officers,
                                    sheriffs, and/or “posses” on four related grounds.

                                    First, many deaths were
                                    “custodial”
                                    deaths in that the incident took place while the victim was in the custody of a law
                                    enforcement
                                    officer. The documents collected suggest that many law enforcement officers were
                                    either
                                    themselves perpetrators of violence or failed to protect victims from violence

                                    Second, law enforcement officers often justified their
                                    homicidal acts
                                    as
                                    “self-defense.” More often than not, the cumulative effect of the documentary
                                    evidence
                                    contests

                                    Third, county sheriffs often deputized civilian
                                    groups as
                                    “posses,” thereby allowing vigilante groups to operate under color of law. 
                                </p>
                                <p class='step'>
                                    And
                                    finally, law
                                    enforcement played a well-understood role in upholding “race” and “tradition” in the
                                    segregated
                                    South.

                                    1,000 cases of anti-Black killings in 11 former Confederate states from 1930 to

            <p>In 2007, CRRJ held a conference titled Crimes of the Civil Rights Era at Northeastern University School
                of Law. The conference brought veterans of the 1960s-era civil rights movement together with scholars,
                lawyers, and journalists. Guided by Congressman Bennie Thompson (MS), Senator Doug Jones (AL) (at the
                time a private lawyer), Myrlie Evers, Rita Bender, Jerry Mitchell, and Manning Marable, among others,
                the participants discussed the efforts of a group of prosecutors and journalists in the South to reopen
                cold civil rights-era cases.</p>

            <p>It was apparent that there remained many cases of anti-Black violence from that period which had been
                mishandled by law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and courts. The goal of the Emmett Till Civil
                Rights Cold Case Act, then pending in Congress and signed into law in 2008, was to create a procedure
                for re-examining these cases and bringing fresh prosecutions. The conference brought together a
                community that would support the state and federal criminal trials that we thought might be forthcoming.
                We also considered the merits of alternative remedial approaches to bring public awareness to this
                history, such as truth commissions and official apologies.</p>

            <p>After this gathering, Melissa Nobles, then a professor of political science at the Massachusetts
                Institute of Technology, and Margaret Burnham, a professor of law at Northeastern, acting independently
                initially, began to collect material on cases of anti-Black homicide that were outside of the scope of
                the Till Act. As they searched newspapers for contemporary reports on these older cold cases, it became
                clear that there were hundreds of incidents that had never been investigated. What started as a rather
                scattered effort to investigate these incidents and work with the affected families eventually became a
                well-defined project to collect data on racially motivated killings of Black people in the Jim Crow
                South, leading, ultimately, to this Archive.</p>

            <p>Since 2009, these incidents have been investigated by law students, graduate students in journalism and
            public history, and undergraduates. About four hundred students have worked on the project. Our purpose is
            to recover documents relating to African Americans’ experiences with state and federal law enforcement and
            criminal justice systems in the South in the mid-twentieth century. By addressing the relationship between
            racial violence and official silence or misinformation, this collection fills important gaps in our
            knowledge about this period.
