1043,Tommie Woods,Columbus - Colorado County - Texas,1954,Texas,"Tommie Woods, about 78, a farmer, was killed in 1954 by Sheriff J. O. Walker and Deputy Sheriff Ed Potter in Colorado County, Texas. Walker and Potter were at a tavern to intervene in a fight in which Woods was apparently not involved. There are conflicting accounts of what exactly happened in the fight that broke out between patrons and the officers, but in the melee, two shots were fired, one of which hit and killed Woods.  There was a DOJ investigation; federal authorities concluded the killing of Woods was wanton and unnecessary but decided to close the case after determining the variation between the eyewitness accounts would prove to be too difficult to overcome if they prosecuted.
