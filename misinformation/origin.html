            "children": [{"Name": "Stolen out of Canadian lab","Count":10, "Tooltip": "<b>Date Recorded</b>: June 20 <br> <b>MYTH</b>: “The COVID-19 virus was stolen out of a Canadian lab by Chinese spies.” <br> <b>FACT</b>: PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. concluded that there is no evidence to back this claim. The evidence provided for the claim was that two Chinese scientists were escorted from the lab in July 2019. The CBC did, in fact, report that two Chinese scientists were escorted from the lab that month. However, the Public Health Agency of Canada told the CBC that they were asked to leave due to an investigation of what it described as a “policy breach” and “administrative matter,” which were not connected to COVID-19. “This is misinformation and there is no factual basis for claims being made on social media,” PHAC spokesperson Eric Morrissette told the CBC in January 2020. <br> <b>HOW THE HOAX EMERGED</b>: The earliest example of this claim was an article on GreatGameIndia.com titled “Coronavirus Bioweapon–How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.” The article was then republished, word-for-word, on Red-rated misinformation site ZeroHedge.com, then one of the top 900 sites in the U.S., whose version was subsequently reposted on RedStateWatcher.com, an anonymously-run conservative site."},
                {"Name":"Contains HIV-like insertions","Count":10, "Tooltip": "<b>Date Recorded</b>: June 20 <br> <b>MYTH</b>: “The COVID-19 virus contains ‘HIV-like insertions,’ suggesting it was engineered.” <br> <b>FACT</b>: This claim was attributed to research posted on the website BioRxiv.org, where users can submit scientific studies before they have been peer-reviewed and published. According to the fact-checking website HealthFeedback.org, the study’s finding that there is a similarity between the new strain of coronavirus and HIV “was detected using extremely short protein sequences, a practice that often gives rise to false positive results,” and the authors failed to note that the same sequences are found in many other organisms. The authors of the study withdrew it from BioRxiv.org two days after it first appeared on the website. <br> <b>HOW THE HOAX EMERGED</b>: The preprint study on BioRxiv.org was first promoted by Harvard University epidemiologist and health economist Eric Feigl-Ding in a series of tweets on Jan. 31, 2020, though he did note the study had not been peer-reviewed. Ding’s tweets and the preprint study were then cited in a ZeroHedge.com article posted that same day, which was in turn republished in full on InfoWars.com, a Red-rated far-right website that falsely asserted that the mass shooting Sandy Hook Elementary was a hoax."},
                {"Name":"Was predicted in a simulation","Count":10, "Tooltip": "<b>Date Recorded</b>: June 20 <br> <b>MYTH</b>: “The COVID-19 pandemic was predicted in a simulation.” <br> <b>FACT</b>: The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Gates Foundation did host a pandemic preparedness exercise called Event 201 in October 2019. However the scenario used in the exercise involved a fictional coronavirus with different characteristics than the COVID-19 virus. For example, in this simulation, the virus originated on pig farms in Brazil, not in China. <br> <b>HOW THE HOAX EMERGED</b>: This earliest example of this claim was Jan. 22, 2020 post on Reddit’s conspiracy subreddit channel, referencing October 2019 news articles about the simulation along with more recent articles about the outbreak in China. It was then more widely circulated in a Jan. 23 article from InfoWars."},
                {"Name":"Patented by group funded by Gates","Count":10, "Tooltip": "<b>Date Recorded</b>: June 20 <br> <b>MYTH</b>: “A group funded by Bill Gates patented the COVID-19 virus.” <br> <b>FACT</b>: While it is true that the U.K.-based Pirbright Institute has accepted funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the patent referenced in these claims covers a separate strain of coronavirus that only affects chickens, not humans. “Pirbright does not currently work with human coronaviruses,” the institute said in a January 2020 post on its website responding to the patent conspiracy theory. <br> <b>HOW THE HOAX EMERGED</b>: Fact-checking websites FactCheck.org and Snopes pointed to a Jan. 21, 2020 tweet from Jordan Sather, a U.S. conspiracy theorist with 140,000 Twitter followers and 218,000 subscribers to his “Destroying the Illusion” YouTube channel, as the earliest example of this claim. InfoWars then repeated it in the Jan. 23 article about the simulation co-hosted by the Gates Foundation described above."},
                {"Name":"Is a manmade bioweapon","Count":10, "Tooltip": "<b>Date Recorded</b>: June 20 <br> <b>MYTH</b>: “The COVID-19 virus is a manmade bioweapon.” <br> <b>FACT</b>: Scientific evidence points to the virus originating in bats. A study published in the journal Nature in February 2020 found the new virus’s genome is “96 percent identical” to a bat coronavirus. A March 2020 study published in the journal Nature Medicine concluded that the virus “is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” <br> <b>HOW THE HOAX EMERGED</b>: Similar conspiracy theories have been promoted by misinformation websites during earlier disease outbreaks. For example, NaturalNews.com, a Red-rated network of site promoting both medical and political conspiracies, previously labeled the Ebola virus as a “bioweapon” during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa. The earliest mention NewsGuard could find of the COVID-19 virus being called a “bioweapon” was a Jan. 23, 2020 video from U.S. conspiracy theorist David Zublick, titled “Breaking: Coronavirus Is Bioweapon For Population Control.” Zublick has 160,000 subscribers on YouTube."},
                {"Name":"5G technology spreads Covid-19","Count":10, "Tooltip": "<b>Date Recorded</b>: June 20 <br> <b>MYTH</b>: “5G cell phone technology is linked to Covid-19 outbreak.” <br> <b>FACT</b>: A March 2020 report from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection found no evidence that 5G networks posed a risk to human health. In a BBC article , Dr. Simon Clarke, a microbiology professor at the University of Reading, said that claims that 5G either transmits the virus, or suppresses the immune system, thus making people more vulnerable to it are “complete rubbish.” <br> <b>HOW THE HOAX EMERGED</b>: The earliest mention NewsGuard could find tying 5G to the new coronavirus was a Jan. 20, 2020 article on the Red-rated, anonymously-run French conspiracy theory blog Les Moutons Enragés. The claims then spread across Facebook groups and YouTube channels already steeped in misleading 5G claims (such as asserting that it can cause cancer). They were then amplified on social media by celebrities including actor Woody Harrelson and boxer Amir Khan. Some people in the U.K. eventually attacked 5G telephone poles, prompting the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport to call on platforms to take action against the spread of these conspiracies."}]};
