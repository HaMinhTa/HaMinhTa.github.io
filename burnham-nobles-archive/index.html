            </div>
            <div class="bodyText">
                <p>On April 27, 1943, Edwin Clifford Williams, his wife, Lillian, and two young sons, were on their way
                    home from Beautiful Zion Baptist Church. As they passed under the Newton Street Viaduct in Algiers,
                    three white navy sailors, 19-year-old Walter Curry Sherwood, Paul O’Malley, and A.B. Bright were
                    drinking above the viaduct. The sailors, for reasons unknown, proceeded to pour beer over Lillian
                    and their infant son. When Williams protested, the sailors descended from above the viaduct, smashed
                    some beer bottles, and stabbed him with a broken bottle in front of his family.
                </p>

                <p>The day after her husband’s death, Lillian Alveris Williams provided a statement to Daniel Byrd, then
                    president of the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP. Byrd alerted Thurgood Marshall, who
                    closely followed the proceedings. Despite these efforts, the family never received justice in court.
                </p>

                <p>Only one of the assailants was ever tried, and he was acquitted of manslaughter charges after less
                    than an hour of deliberations by a jury. Nearly 80 years later, attention to Williams' murder was
                    revived through a clinic by the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project (CRRJ) at Northeastern
                    University School of Law, which offers opportunities for students to work in the domains of
                    historical redress and criminal justice reform.</p>

                <p>Students in the clinic investigate cases available in the Burnham-Nobles
                    archive, a collection of racial killings of Black people between 1930 and 1954 in the
                    Jim Crow South. Erin McCrady, a law student, investigated the case between 2020 and 2021.
                </p>

                <p>Williams’ story was one in more than a thousand stories of unjust killing of Black lives in the Jim
                    Crow South documented in the Burnham-Nobles archive, which was made available publicly in October,
                    2022. The Archive brings together evidence demonstrating the extensive scale and scope of killings
                    between 1930 and 1954 in the Jim Crow South.
                </p>

                <p>Circumstances and allegations against the victims that eventually led to their killings were
                    wide-ranging.</p>

                <p>They included, but were not limited to, murdering a police officer, murdering a white landlord over a
                    debt, attacking a white man, raping a white woman, attempting to rape a white woman, writing to a
                    white woman, having romantic relations with a white woman, making untrue statements about a white
                    woman, bumping into a white woman, committing burglary, winning too much at gambling, quitting a
                    job, failing to show up to work, driving erraticly, arguing over wages, raising fist in a sign of
                    aggression, peeping into a neighbor's window, refusing to say "yes, sir" and "no, sir" to a police
                    officer, refusing to obey a white man's order to tuck in his shirt, engaging in union organizing,
                    trying to mediate an argument over bus fares between a bus driver and a 17-year-old boy, protesting
                    son’s arrest, being near a traffic accident, crossing a municipal golf course, loitering, sitting on
                    a bench, or, in William’s case, defending his family from assault.
                </p>
                <p>Since 2009, these incidents have been investigated by law students, graduate students in journalism
                    and
                    public history, and undergraduates at CRRJ clinics. About four hundred students have worked on the
                    project, poring through newspapers, police records, archival collections, federal reports and
                    genealogical databases for details on these cold cases. They have preserved and logged 20,000 pieces
                    of evidence for 1,000 cases of anti-Black killings in 11 former Confederate states from 1930 to
                    1954.</p>
                <p>CRRJ defines racial killings as
                    killings
                    "where racial animus or perceived infraction of Jim Crow norms and customs can be
                    documented
                    or reasonably inferred from newspaper reports and supporting documents."</p>

                            <p class='step'>59% of the victims were killed by law enforcement
                                officers.

                                The Burnham-Nobles Archive based its decision to include cases involving police
                                officers,
                                sheriffs, and/or “posses” on four related grounds.

                                First, many deaths were
                                “custodial”
                                deaths in that the incident took place while the victim was in the custody of a law
                                enforcement
                                officer. The documents collected suggest that many law enforcement officers were
                                either
                                themselves perpetrators of violence or failed to protect victims from violence
                                enacted by
                                private individuals.
                            </p>
                            <p class='step'>
                                Second, law enforcement officers often justified their
                                homicidal acts
                                as
                                “self-defense.” More often than not, the cumulative effect of the documentary
                                evidence
                                contests
                                and complicates, those claims.

                                Third, county sheriffs often deputized civilian
                                groups as
                                “posses,” thereby allowing vigilante groups to operate under color of law.

                                enforcement played a well-understood role in upholding “race” and “tradition” in the
                                segregated
